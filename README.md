# baby-names

This is a Vue.js app which allows quick searches of a male or female name and generates a graph (using Chart.js) to track how popular they've been over time. 

The data was pulled from the US Data and Statistics page. 

The back end is Laravel and includes instant search with a simple query to match names. One problem that I initially had was how to sort out typing in a name and getting every instance of the name it was used in each year. A simple javascript expression sorted that all out. 

I've put this project on the back burner for the meantime.
